    <h1>Welcome Warriors! This page will provide a basic Overview of how Weapons works in Genesys.</h1>
    <p>There are 8 different combat skills. There is Brawl, Gunnery, Melee, Melee-Light, Melee-Heavy, Ranged, Ranged-Light, and Ranged Heavy.</p>
    <p>Each weapon will relate to a different combat skill. Up to the GM's discression, they may have you use just Melee instead of Melee-Light and Melee-Heavy. And the same with Ranged.</p>
